# Simple REST API using MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js

This is a simple RESTful API for managing a collection of resources (e.g., books, products, etc.) using MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>


Install dependencies:
cd <project_folder>
npm install


Configure MongoDB:

Ensure your MongoDB server is running.
Set up your MongoDB connection string in the config/config.js file.
Start the server:


npm start


DELETE /api/resources/:id
Delete a specific resource by its ID.

Error Handling
The API handles common errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in the response.

Authentication and Authorization
This is a simplified API without authentication and authorization mechanisms. In a real-world scenario, you should implement appropriate security measures to protect your resources and restrict access.

Database Schema
The database schema for resources is defined in models/resourceModel.js.

Dependencies
express: Web application framework
mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool
body-parser: Middleware for parsing request bodies
dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file
morgan: HTTP request logger middleware

Please note that this is a generic README template, and you may need to customize it according to your specific project and requirements. Provide more information about the API's features, the structure of your code, and any other relevant details. Also, consider adding instructions for testing and deploying the API in a production environment if applicable.
